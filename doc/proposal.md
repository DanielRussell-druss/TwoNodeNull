<h1>About Brewski++</h1>

Brewski++ will be a webpage that allows users to select from a huge library of beers with a drop down menu or keystroke and add them to a list of tried beers.  Additionally, at least a few different list options, such as "Favorites" and/or "Wishlist," will give the user the ability to optimize how they choose to use the website.  Users will also be allowed to add beers that are not listed to the project.

<h2> Features </h2>

• Select any beer from drop down list or through keystrokes.

• View information of selected product such as abv and type (ie. IPA).

• Create different list categories, such as "Beers Tried", "Wishlist", and "Favorites."

• Beer is not on the list?  No problem, add it to the project.

<h2> Dependencies </h2>

Brewski++ is a product that will be implemented as a webpage using ASP.NET Core MVC, some form of JavaScript,  and my MySQL.  We will be using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) methodology, which will allow us to efficiently modularize our code in a way that promotes reusability and readability.

<h3> Front End </h3>

Our Client-Side operations will be implemented with some form of JavaScript.

<h3> Back End </h3>

Our Back End operations will be implemented with ASP.NET Core MVC.

<h3> Database </h3>

Our Database will be handled with MySQL.  We have current applications pending with BreweryDB and Untapped to be granted access to their robust API's.  Otherwise we already have access to a smaller, sub-optimal, open source community database.

<h2> Example usage </h2>

Anyone with interests in a certain kind of beer can use this project to look up the information by themselves while also adding them to a list they deem fit for their purpose.  If they find some strange brews that have never been documented before then they can add it to the list, contributing to the project.
