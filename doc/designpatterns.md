## Brewskii++ Design Patterns
	
### Factory Pattern

The Brewskii++ uses one of the most common design patterns in object oriented programming, the factory pattern. We create objects behind the scenes without delivering any of the implementation to our user. An example would be the user being able to create a beer and add it to a list without seeing any of the logic behind the operation.  

### Other Patterns

Prototype - The Prototype pattern looks like a convenient way to reuse properties of an object; we may be able to implement this with our beer properties.
	
### Module Planning

The main goal of our current module development is to have a workable release in the next few weeks.  We want to have the bulk of our webpage presentable and add optimizations after every working update.  The modules will be split into the implementation in the controller, the user interface, and database management.  Our group has different strengths and we will handle difficult situations by working together and delegating specific tasks where necessary.
