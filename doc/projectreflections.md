<h1> Project Reflections </h1>

<h2> Andrew's Reflection: </h2>

  We started this project with an idea of a Web Application on a platform that none of us had ever worked on before. As Daniel has mentioned below, time passed much more quickly than any of us would have believed possible. I think that in retrospect, breaking up the larger project into smaller deliverable objectives might result in a final product that is more in line with our initial direction. Completion of smaller objectives would also help drive project progress as success in smaller bites might serve to drive understanding of the larger issues we faced with implementation. I am very happy with the contributions of my group on our project, but I feel that if I had a fresh semester where I could focus less on my full time third shift job and my capstone project, I would have personally been able to deliver much more.

  One thing I can say for certain in this project is that time has went by much faster than I anticipated.  We felt good in the beginning of the semester with a kind of overall idea of how things would progress but it has changed quite a lot.  Some of the tools/frameworks have changed the more we realized what we needed and we still have not done adequate testing! We all came in with the idea of trying something we haven't tried before and we have learned and are still learning a lot.  So far, I have done quite a bit of documentation and some coding (UI work).  I have also contributed to planning through the projects tab and making sure we are all on the same page as to what our desired outcome with the project is and how we may be able to achieve those ideas.
