  One thing I can say for certain in this project is that time has went by much faster than I anticipated.  We felt good in the beginning of the semester with a kind of overall idea of how things would progress but it has changed quite a lot.  Some of the tools/frameworks have changed the more we realized what we needed and we still have not done adequate testing! We all came in with the idea of trying something we haven't tried before and we have learned and are still learning a lot.  So far, I have done quite a bit of documentation and some coding (UI work).  I have also contributed to planning through the projects tab and making sure we are all on the same page as to what our desired outcome with the project is and how we may be able to achieve those ideas.
